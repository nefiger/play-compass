# Play Compass â€” Codex Tasks

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview
This is a playful, modern website for showcasing interactive games, concepts, and thought leadership around adult play. Built with Next.js 14 (app router) and Tailwind CSS.

SVG assets live in `/public/assets/`.
Styles are configured in `tailwind.config.js`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Codex: Help me implement the following

### âœ… Layout & Styling
1. Resize and display the `/public/assets/logo.svg` appropriately in the homepage hero
2. Add grass SVG strips (`grass.svg`) at the top and bottom of the homepage
3. Ensure all SVGs are responsive and look good on mobile

### ðŸ“š Blog Setup
4. Set up a blog using MDX (e.g. under `/src/app/blog/`)
5. Each blog post should support title, date, and markdown content
6. Create a simple blog index page that lists all posts with links

### ðŸŽ¨ Theming
7. Use the custom Tailwind theme defined in `tailwind.config.js`
8. Apply a playful but clean aesthetic (whitespace, rounded corners, animations)

### ðŸ“± Responsiveness
9. Ensure the homepage looks good on both mobile and desktop
10. Add responsive Tailwind classes as needed

## ðŸ”§ Optional Enhancements (for later)
- Add a basic mobile menu with a hamburger toggle
- Add a "Start Playing" button on the homepage that links to a future quest system
